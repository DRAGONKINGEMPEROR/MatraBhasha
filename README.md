Sense annotated corpus
	We have used a sense annotated corpus of Hindi language to perform WSD by applying the proposed approach. A sense annotated corpus is a collection of contexts of particular senses, meanings of the senses, and no of senses for each ambiguous word. There are directories made on the name of the ambiguous words and in each directory there are several files, which include the ContextSenses and Senses whose numbers depend on the no of senses that word has in standard Hindi language. For example, ‘सोना’ word is an ambiguous word with two senses, one means gold and other means to sleep.
 
	                                
The ContextSenses files consist of various paragraphs that are based on the use of the target word in a particular sense for that number. For example, ContextSenses002 contains paragraphs that are based on the meaning ‘to sleep’ for the word ‘सोना’.
 
Then there are files named Senses which consist of meanings for the ambiguous word to make the user understand the meaning portrayed by the sense that is being pointed to after the comparison.
